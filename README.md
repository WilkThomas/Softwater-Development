### Description of Project for D0
Demo 0 consisted of a basic GUI using Java Swing that parsed a CSV file based on some filters. Was used as a proof of concept.
### Description of Project for D1
Demo 1 consisted of a big change away from Java Swing and instead using R Shiny to develop the GUI. Used a CSV of the database data and actually performs what was intended instead of a proof of concept. For example, actual filters and charts.
