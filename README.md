## Instructions for Running
The app is developed in R using RStudio. Using RStudio, open the project doing Open Project and navigating to the project file in the SoftwaterDevelopment directory. Then, in the consol of RStudio, run data <- read.csv("USGSPWDBv2.3n.csv"). Then you can press the Run App button in RStudio near the top right. 
## Description of Project for D0
Demo 0 consisted of a basic GUI using Java Swing that parsed a CSV file based on some filters. Was used as a proof of concept.
## Description of Project for D1
Demo 1 consisted of a big change away from Java Swing and instead using R Shiny to develop the GUI. Used a CSV of the database data and actually performs what was intended instead of a proof of concept. For example, actual filters and charts.
## Description of Project for D2
Demo 2 will show more options within the user selections.  The user can now select data geographically 3 different ways (state, county, or basin name).  Selections are also sorted for ease of use.  The output of the application now includes multiple options: a reactive bar graph, a mathematical summary of the data, and a reactive table with sorting and search options.  Reactive functionality for all outputs works well.
